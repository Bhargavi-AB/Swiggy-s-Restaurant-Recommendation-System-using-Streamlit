## Swiggy Restaurant Recommendation System 🍽️

## A content-based restaurant recommendation system built using Machine Learning and Streamlit.  
## The system recommends similar restaurants based on cuisine, city, rating, and cost.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- This project mimics real-world food delivery recommendation systems like Swiggy/Zomato.
- A scalable Nearest Neighbors approach is used instead of a full similarity matrix to avoid memory issues.
- Users can explore recommendations through an interactive Streamlit app.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

---

## 🔄 Workflow

- Clean and preprocess Swiggy restaurant data
- Encode categorical and numerical features
- Build recommendation engine using cosine similarity
- Deploy interactive recommendations using Streamlit

---

## 🧠 Recommendation Approach

- Content-based filtering
- Cosine similarity with Nearest Neighbors
- On-demand similarity computation for scalability

---

## 🚀 Run the Project

- git clone https://github.com/your-username/swiggy-recommendation-system.git
- cd swiggy_recommendation
- python -m venv env
- env\Scripts\activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- streamlit run app.py

---

## 🎯 Key Highlights

- Handled missing values and encoding issues
- Avoided large memory usage from full similarity matrix
- Built a scalable, production-ready recommendation system
